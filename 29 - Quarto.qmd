## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
smaller <- diamonds|>
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of teh remainder is shown below.

```{r}
#| label: plot-smaller-diamonds
#| echo: false

smaller|>
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
