Usually, read_csv() uses the first line of the data for the column names, which is a very common convention. But itâ€™s not uncommon for a few lines of metadata to be included at the top of the file. You can use skip = n to skip the first n lines or use comment = "#" to drop all lines that start with (e.g.) #.
